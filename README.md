# execution-evaluation-experiments

This repository contains PCM models of the JPetstore to evaluate the execution of system adaptations. For each adaptation to be tested there is a runtime and a redeployment model. The further represents the JPetStore's present architecture and the latter represents its intended architecture after the adaptation's execution.

The correspondence model maps the PCM model components to the deployable images.
